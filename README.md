Research Study : "Sectoral Analysis of Oil Price Fluctuations" 

(To access a PDF document, remember to download it with the "raw" option to be able to open it.)

As part of the project, I have access to 3 databases in Excel format, containing numerous variables, the main ones being: the price of Brent crude oil since 1970, the quantities produced, and the Kilian index (which is a monthly indicator of actual global economic activity).

The project was carried out using R, and the entire process is documented in an R Markdown file. To view the output of the project, please go to VAR_model.html and download the raw file to take a closer look.
