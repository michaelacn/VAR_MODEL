Research Study : "Sectoral Analysis of Oil Price Fluctuations" 

(To access a PDF document, remember to download it with the "raw" option to be able to open it.)

As part of the project, I have access to 3 databases in Excel format containing the price of Brent crude oil since 1970, the quantities produced, and the Kilian index (which is a monthly indicator of actual global economic activity).

The project was carried out using R but I managed to present the project's output in a notebook format. To view the results, please refer to the VAR_model.ipynb file.
