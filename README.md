Research Study : "Sectoral Analysis of Oil Price Fluctuations" 

(To access a PDF document, remember to download it with the "raw" option to be able to open it.)

As part of the project, I have access to 3 databases in Excel format containing the price of Brent crude oil since 1970, the quantities produced, and the Kilian index (which is a monthly indicator of actual global economic activity).

Although I was able to present the output of the project in a notebook, the graphics did not display properly because the project was carried out using R.

The entire process is also documented in an R Markdown file. To view the proper output of the project, please go to VAR_model.html and download the raw file to take a closer look.
