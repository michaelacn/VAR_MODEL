Research Study : "Sectoral Analysis of Oil Price Fluctuations" 

(To access a PDF document, remember to download it with the "raw" option to be able to open it.)

As part of the project, I have access to 4 databases in Excel format containing the price of Brent crude oil since 1970, the quantities produced, the Kilian index (a monthly indicator of actual global economic activity) and the KEI database (economic activity of countries).

The project was carried out using R but I managed to present the project's output in a notebook format. To view the results, please refer to the "VAR_model.ipynb" file.

In addition, you can explore the descriptive statistics available in the "dataviz.png" file, as well as refer to the "theoretical_framework.png" for an overview of the theoretical framework adopted to guide the implementation of the approach.
